# 🌍 Satellite Image Analysis for Deforestation Monitoring

This project detects and monitors deforestation using satellite imagery from the Amazon rainforest.

## 🧠 Model
- Uses CNNs for land classification.
- Change detection on sequential images.
- Visualizes deforestation progress over time.

## 📊 Dataset
**Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space**

## 🚀 Steps
1. Preprocessing multi-band satellite images.
2. Training CNN for land cover classification.
3. Detecting changes using sequential data.
4. Visualization of deforested regions.

## 🔧 How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train.py
python evaluate.py
python visualize.py
